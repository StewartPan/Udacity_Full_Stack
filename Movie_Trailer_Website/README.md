# Movie Trailer Website Project Documentation

## Project Structure
The Movie class is defined in `media.py`. It has four variables: title, storyline, poster_image_rul, trailer_youtube_url
The movies instances are created in `media.py`. 
The `fresh_tomatoes.py` is used to produced a html file that displays movies.

## How to run
Just run the media file. than the browser will open the website.

## Others
The storyline might be too long to display in one line. But if I use "" or '' to separate them in 
different, it might create confusion that how many parameters in the constructor, besides it is not important in this project. So I just leave it the way it is.
